# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health indicators and lifestyle factors, we develop a model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and implementing preventive measures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about patients, with 17 features for each individual. These features include:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each patient
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **education**: Education level (1-4)
- **sex**: Gender (M/F)
- **is_smoking**: Smoking status (YES/NO)
- **cigsPerDay**: Number of cigarettes smoked per day
- **BPMeds**: Blood pressure medication usage (0/1)
- **prevalentStroke**: History of stroke (0/1)
- **prevalentHyp**: Presence of hypertension (0/1)
- **diabetes**: Presence of diabetes (0/1)
- **totChol**: Total cholesterol level
- **sysBP**: Systolic blood pressure
- **diaBP**: Diastolic blood pressure
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **heartRate**: Heart rate
- **glucose**: Glucose level
- **TenYearCHD**: 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (target variable, 0/1)

This comprehensive dataset includes demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, and various health measurements, providing a solid foundation for developing an accurate predictive model.

## Key Features of the Project

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Thorough analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced techniques to capture complex interactions between health indicators.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various models to predict CHD risk.
- **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**: Providing insights into the most important risk factors and the model’s performance.
