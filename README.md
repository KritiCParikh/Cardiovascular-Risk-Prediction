# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health indicators and lifestyle factors, we develop a model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and implementing preventive measures.

## Skills and Technologies:

* Python

* Data Analysis: Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  
* Data Visualization: Employing Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations of the dataset.
  
* Machine Learning: Implementing various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests using Scikit-learn.

* Feature Engineering: Performing data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

* Model Evaluation: Utilizing cross-validation techniques and various performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC) to assess model performance.
  
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Applying Grid Search to optimize model parameters for improved performance.
  
* Statistical Analysis: Using libraries like StatsModels for in-depth statistical modeling.

### Business Impact

1. Early Risk Identification: By accurately predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease, healthcare providers can identify high-risk patients early, enabling timely interventions and preventive care.
2. Resource Allocation: Healthcare systems can use these predictions to allocate resources more efficiently, focusing on patients with higher risk profiles.
3. Personalized Care Plans: The model's insights can help in developing personalized treatment and lifestyle modification plans for patients based on their risk factors.
4. Cost Reduction: Early intervention and prevention strategies based on accurate risk prediction can potentially reduce the long-term healthcare costs associated with treating advanced heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about patients, with 17 features for each individual. These features include:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each patient
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **education**: Education level (1-4)

- **cigsPerDay**: Number of cigarettes smoked per day
- **BPMeds**: Blood pressure medication usage (0/1)
- **prevalentStroke**: History of stroke (0/1)
- **prevalentHyp**: Presence of hypertension (0/1)
- **diabetes**: Presence of diabetes (0/1)
- **totChol**: Total cholesterol level
- **sysBP**: Systolic blood pressure
- **diaBP**: Diastolic blood pressure
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **heartRate**: Heart rate
- **glucose**: Glucose level
- **TenYearCHD**: 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (target variable, 0/1)

This comprehensive dataset includes demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, and various health measurements, providing a solid foundation for developing an accurate predictive model.

## Key Features of the Project
